# Ender3V3KE-PicoMMU
Documentation of adding a PicoMMU to an Ender 3 V3 KE

!!! This is an unfinished and partially untested work-in-progress !!!

Prerequisits:
- Printer is on mainline klipper (I did this running a Creality Serial to USB Adapter for Sonic Pad and a BTT Pi V1.2)

Models used so far:
[https://www.printables.com/model/1126928-filament-cutter-for-ender-3-v3-se#preview.ER84t](https://www.printables.com/model/1126928-filament-cutter-for-ender-3-v3-se)

Models that could be useful:
https://www.printables.com/model/1125296-pico-mmu-toolhead-filament-hub-for-ender-3-v3-se

Plans:
- merge the two models above and create a 4 channel version of the hub
- create a macro to cut filament
- redesign block for filament cutter to improve stability
