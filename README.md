# Ender3V3KE-PicoMMU
Documentation of adding a PicoMMU to an Ender 3 V3 KE

!!! This is an unfinished and partially untested work-in-progress !!!

__Prerequisites:__
- Printer is on mainline klipper (I did this running a Creality Serial to USB Adapter for Sonic Pad and a BTT Pi V1.2)

[Models that could be useful for this project (Printables Collection)](https://www.printables.com/@Leetsch2002_1829799/collections/2125653)

__ToDo:__
- [ ] merge E3V3SE filament cutter and 4 channel version of the PicoMMU filament hub to fit E3V3KE cable clamp mounting holes
- [ ] create a macro to cut filament
- [ ] build PicoMMU

__Note:__ This will probably be compatible with the SE too (when running mainline Klipper), but I don't have an SE and only test and work on the KE.

__Disclaimer:__ Please be aware that some of these steps may damage your printer if you are not careful, I am not responsible for damage to your printer!
